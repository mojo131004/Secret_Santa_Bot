## Setup

This bot requires a Discord bot token.

Set the token via environment variable:

DISCORD_TOKEN=your_token_here

For security reasons, the token is NOT included in the source code or repository.

## Project Background

This project originally started as a **Secret Santa (Wichteln) bot** for a private Discord server.
The initial goal was to randomly assign participants for a Secret Santa event.

However, the event was never carried out. Instead of abandoning the project, the bot was continuously
expanded and evolved into a **multi-purpose Discord game and utility bot**.

Over time, additional features such as mini-games, slash commands, activity tracking and interactive
game modes were implemented, turning the project into a modular and extensible bot.

### Application Version

This branch represents a professional application-focused version of the project,
with features selected to demonstrate clean architecture, security practices
and maintainable code.
